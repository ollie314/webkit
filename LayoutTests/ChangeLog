        REGRESSION(r205883): Letterpressed text is invisible
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162590

        Reviewed by Simon Fraser.

        Letterpress is only implemented on iOS, so letterpress-different.html is marked
        as only passing on iOS. letterpress-paint.html makes sure that letterpressed paint
        is not invisible.
