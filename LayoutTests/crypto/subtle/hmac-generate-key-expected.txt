Test generating a HMAC key.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS crypto.subtle.generateKey("hmac", extractable, ["sign", "verify"]) threw exception TypeError: Type error.
PASS crypto.subtle.generateKey({name: "hmac"}, extractable, ["sign", "verify"]) threw exception NotSupportedError (DOM Exception 9): The operation is not supported..
PASS crypto.subtle.generateKey({name: "hmac", length: undefined}, extractable, ["sign", "verify"]) threw exception NotSupportedError (DOM Exception 9): The operation is not supported..
PASS crypto.subtle.generateKey({name: "hmac", length: {}}, extractable, ["sign", "verify"]) threw exception NotSupportedError (DOM Exception 9): The operation is not supported..
