On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS candidate = new RTCIceCandidate(initializer); did not throw exception.
PASS candidate.candidate is "foo"
PASS candidate.sdpMid is "bar"
PASS candidate.sdpMLineIndex is 6

Attributes are readonly
candidate.candidate = "foo-updated"
PASS candidate.candidate is "foo"
candidate.sdpMid = "bar-updated"
PASS candidate.sdpMid is "bar"
candidate.sdpMLineIndex = 7
PASS candidate.sdpMLineIndex is 6

Dictionary argument is mandatory.
PASS new RTCIceCandidate(); threw exception TypeError: Not enough arguments.
Dictionary member 'candidate' is required.
PASS new RTCIceCandidate({}); threw exception TypeError: Type error.
PASS new RTCIceCandidate({sdpMid:"bar", sdpMLineIndex:6}); threw exception TypeError: Type error.
PASS new RTCIceCandidate({sdpMid:"bar"}); threw exception TypeError: Type error.
PASS new RTCIceCandidate({sdpMLineIndex:6}); threw exception TypeError: Type error.

One of the 'sdpMid' or 'sdpMLineIndex' members must be present (and not null or undefined).
PASS new RTCIceCandidate({candidate:"foo"}); threw exception TypeError: Type error.
PASS new RTCIceCandidate({candidate:"foo", sdpMid: null}); threw exception TypeError: Type error.
PASS new RTCIceCandidate({candidate:"foo", sdpMid: undefined}); threw exception TypeError: Type error.
PASS new RTCIceCandidate({candidate:"foo", sdpMLineIndex: null}); threw exception TypeError: Type error.
PASS new RTCIceCandidate({candidate:"foo", sdpMLineIndex: undefined}); threw exception TypeError: Type error.
PASS new RTCIceCandidate({candidate:"foo", sdpMid: null, sdpMLineIndex: null}); threw exception TypeError: Type error.
PASS new RTCIceCandidate({candidate:"foo", sdpMid: undefined, sdpMLineIndex: undefined}); threw exception TypeError: Type error.

Test that sdpMid or sdpMLineIndex explicitly set to null or undefined, results in a null value.
PASS candidate = new RTCIceCandidate({candidate:"foo", sdpMid: null, sdpMLineIndex: 1}); did not throw exception.
PASS candidate.sdpMid is null
PASS candidate.sdpMLineIndex is 1
PASS candidate = new RTCIceCandidate({candidate:"foo", sdpMid: undefined, sdpMLineIndex: 1}); did not throw exception.
PASS candidate.sdpMid is null
PASS candidate.sdpMLineIndex is 1
PASS candidate = new RTCIceCandidate({candidate:"foo", sdpMid: "foo", sdpMLineIndex: null}); did not throw exception.
PASS candidate.sdpMid is 'foo'
PASS candidate.sdpMLineIndex is null
PASS candidate = new RTCIceCandidate({candidate:"foo", sdpMid: "foo", sdpMLineIndex: undefined}); did not throw exception.
PASS candidate.sdpMid is 'foo'
PASS candidate.sdpMLineIndex is null

When one of the 'sdpMid' or 'sdpMLineIndex' members is set, the other must be null.
PASS candidate = new RTCIceCandidate({candidate:"foo", sdpMid:"bar"}); did not throw exception.
PASS candidate.sdpMid is "bar"
PASS candidate.sdpMLineIndex is null
PASS candidate = new RTCIceCandidate({candidate:"foo", sdpMLineIndex:6}); did not throw exception.
PASS candidate.sdpMid is null
PASS candidate.sdpMLineIndex is 6

PASS new RTCIceCandidate({candidate:"foo", sdpMLineIndex:-1}); threw exception TypeError: Type error.
PASS new RTCIceCandidate({candidate:"foo", sdpMLineIndex:65536}); threw exception TypeError: Type error.
