        Use the cached start time for graph data source properties instead of
        relying on the ruler, which requires a layout in order to be updated
        for the first time.

        Web Inspector: Unfocusing / Focusing inspector window should not change ContentView

        Improve NavigationSidebarPanel logic for coordinating selection between trees.
        When tree selection changes, the most recent selection should be restored
        the next time the tree is focused.

        The sidebar should also handle focusing a tree for the first time, in
        which no previous selection exists, and focusing a tree that has had its
        previous selection filtered out (hidden).

        * UserInterface/Views/NavigationSidebarPanel.js:

        (WebInspector.NavigationSidebarPanel.prototype._contentTreeOutlineTreeSelectionDidChange):
        Restoring the last deselected element, instead of the last selected element
        only works when the selection is moving from one tree to another. When
        the elements belong to the same tree the newly selected element won't
        be saved until the next selection change. If the window loses and regains
        the focus before then, the tree will restore the previous selection,
        effectively reverting the last selection change.

        Web Inspector: Box Model values not updated when DOM node styles change
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162525

        Reviewed by Brian Burg.

        The Box Model section should refresh itself when the selected node's
        computed style changes. This is necessary since the Styles sidebar
        doesn't always refresh its sections on node changes.

        (WebInspector.BoxModelDetailsSectionRow.prototype.set nodeStyles):
        Refresh metrics whenever the computed style changes.
